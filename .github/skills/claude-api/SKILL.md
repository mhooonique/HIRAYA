# Building LLM-Powered Applications with Claude

This skill helps you build LLM-powered applications with Claude. Choose the right surface based on your needs, detect the project language, then read the relevant language-specific documentation.

## Defaults

Unless the user requests otherwise:

For the Claude model version, please use Claude Opus 4.6, which you can access via the exact model string `claude-opus-4-6`. Please default to using adaptive thinking (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) for anything remotely complicated. And finally, please default to streaming for any request that may involve long input, long output, or high `max_tokens` — it prevents hitting request timeouts. Use the SDK's `.get_final_message()` / `.finalMessage()` helper to get the complete response if you don't need to handle individual stream events

## Language Detection

Before reading code examples, determine which language the user is working in:

1. **Look at project files** to infer the language:

   - `*.py`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` → **Python** — read from `python/`
   - `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` → **TypeScript** — read from `typescript/`
   - `*.js`, `*.jsx` (no `.ts` files present) → **TypeScript** — JS uses the same SDK, read from `typescript/`
   - `*.java`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` → **Java** — read from `java/`
   - `*.kt`, `*.kts`, `build.gradle.kts` → **Java** — Kotlin uses the Java SDK, read from `java/`
   - `*.scala`, `build.sbt` → **Java** — Scala uses the Java SDK, read from `java/`
   - `*.go`, `go.mod` → **Go** — read from `go/`
   - `*.rb`, `Gemfile` → **Ruby** — read from `ruby/`
   - `*.cs`, `*.csproj` → **C#** — read from `csharp/`
   - `*.php`, `composer.json` → **PHP** — read from `php/`

2. **If multiple languages detected** (e.g., both Python and TypeScript files):

   - Check which language the user's current file or question relates to
   - If still ambiguous, ask: "I detected both Python and TypeScript files. Which language are you using for the Claude API integration?"

3. **If language can't be inferred** (empty project, no source files, or unsupported language):

   - Use AskUserQuestion with options: Python, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, cURL/raw HTTP, C#, PHP
   - If AskUserQuestion is unavailable, default to Python examples and note: "Showing Python examples. Let me know if you need a different language."

4. **If unsupported language detected** (Rust, Swift, C++, Elixir, etc.):

   - Suggest cURL/raw HTTP examples from `curl/` and note that community SDKs may exist
   - Offer to show Python or TypeScript examples as reference implementations

5. **If user needs cURL/raw HTTP examples**, read from `curl/`.
